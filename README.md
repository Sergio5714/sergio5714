# 👋 Hi, I’m Sergei
Hardware maker and open-source enthusiast.

🔬 This GitHub is reserved for my open-source contributions, hobby projects, and experiments.

My repositories focus on full-stack electronics design for ultrasound acquisition systems (**[WULPUS PRO](https://github.com/Sergio5714/wulpus-pro)**, **[WULPUS](https://github.com/Sergio5714/wulpus)**), tissue-mimicking phantoms (**[DOPFLOW](https://github.com/Sergio5714/dopflow)**), as well as related software projects such as **[PyBF](https://github.com/Sergio5714/pybf)** (ultrasound beamformer) and **[AEPUS](https://github.com/Sergio5714/AEPUS)** (image annotation tool).

## 🛠️ Fabrication-ready hardware builds

Selected designs are prepared for fabrication and shared with the community via [**PCBWay projects**](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/shareproject/?bmbno=950D9A19-4301-4F).  
These projects are intended for learning, experimentation, and reuse by makers and researchers.
